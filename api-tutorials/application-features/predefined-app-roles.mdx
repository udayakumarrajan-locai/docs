## Introducing Application-wide Predefined Roles

Predefined roles are global roles created at the application level, accessible to all existing and newly onboarded organizations.

### Assigning Predefined Roles
Any user invited or added to an organization can be assigned a predefined role that is defined at the application level. Only **super admins** and **machine users** have access to the APIs associated with predefined roles.

### Managing Predefined Roles
A **super admin** can:
- Add a list of predefined roles along with their associated permissions, making them available across all organizations.
- Assign these roles to users within an organization.
- Delete predefined roles, which will remove them from all existing organizations and prevent their use in new organizations.

### Impact of Deleting a Predefined Role
If a global predefined role is deleted:
- All users assigned to that role will lose their association with it.
- Any permissions granted through that role will be revoked.

### Role Naming Convention
Predefined roles follow a specific naming convention. They must start with:
**`global:*`**
Any role starting with `global:` is considered a predefined global role and is available across all organizations.


> **Note:** While creating a predefined role, do not manually add `global:` to the role name. It will be added automatically for all predefined roles.
