To create a machine or service user who can access the API programmatically,
you would need to make a POST request to the following endpoint:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://dev-iam.razi.ai/v1/authorization/machine-users \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'X-App-Name: ' \
  --data '{
  "userName": "robot"
}'
```

Upon successful creation of the machine user, you will receive a response similar to the below:

```json
{
    "machineUserId": "280719066056893738",
    "clientId": "example-client-id",
    "clientSecret": "zNUTk6frtcdrpEbRiOYx3lGjZpou1oRGVxt40SUj2qkBzUVh8gybTmOObmFvDPKw"
}
```

<Info>
    Use the clientId and clientSecret generated to generate the access token for
    the machine user to authenticate and access the services.
    Store the secrets in a <b>safe</b> and <b>secure</b> place as you will not be able to retrieve them after.
</Info>

<Warning>
    Please note that the client secrets should be unique to each application. Each application should generate its
    own set of client secret.
