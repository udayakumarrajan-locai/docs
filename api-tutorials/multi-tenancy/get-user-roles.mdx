To retrieve all the roles and permissions associated with a user across multiple organizations, the recommended flow is to use below endpoint

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://dev-iam.razi.ai/v1/authorization/organizations/user/21892002/roles \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN' \
  --header 'X-App-Name: '
```

The above endpoint will return a response containing all the roles and permissions across all the organizations
