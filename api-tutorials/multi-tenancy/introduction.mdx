Our IAM Service provides a robust multi-tenancy solution, allowing you to manage multiple organizations and user hierarchies efficiently.

## Role-Based Access Control

The IAM Service implements a comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC) system with four distinct roles:

1. **Super Admin**: The highest level of access, capable of managing all aspects of the product instance across all organizations.

2. **Org Owner**: Possesses full control over a specific organization, including user management and role assignments.

3. **Org Manager**: Manages users within assigned organizations, with the ability to handle multiple organizations simultaneously.

4. **Custom Roles**: Tailored access levels defined by Org Owners or Org Managers, allowing for fine-grained permission control.

This hierarchical structure ensures secure and flexible management of your multi-tenant environment, empowering you to scale your application while maintaining strict access controls.
