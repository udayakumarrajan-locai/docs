To retrieve a list of all organizations accessible to your user, you need to make a GET request to the following endpoint:


```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://dev-iam.razi.ai/v1/authorization/organizations \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN' \
  --header 'X-App-Name: '
```

## Query Parameters
<Steps>

    <Step title="page (optional, number)">
        Specifies the page number to retrieve. Use this parameter to paginate through large sets of organizations. Defaults to 0 if not provided.
        **Example**: ?page=2
    </Step>
    <Step title="pageSize (required, number)">
     Specifies the number of organizations to return per page. This helps to control the size of the response data.
        pageSize must not be greater than 100.
        **Example**: ?pageSize=10
    </Step>
</Steps>
Upon successful request, you will receive a paginated response similar to the below:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "total": 10
  },
  "organizations": [
    {
      "id": "1234567890",
