<Note>
  This API Will return  users for an organization, based on the search criteria provided. If you want list of all users
    of an organization, you can refer [Get All Users of
    organization](/api-tutorials/multi-tenancy/machine-user/get-all-users-of-organization)
    endpoint.
</Note>


To get users from an organization based on the search criteria, you need to make a POST request to the following endpoint:

</Steps>

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://dev-iam.razi.ai/v1/authorization/organizations/users/search \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'X-App-Name: ' \

  --data '{

}'
```
## Query Parameters
<Steps>

    <Step title="page (optional, number)">
        Specifies the page number to retrieve. Use this parameter to paginate through large sets of organizations. Defaults to 0 if not provided.
        **Example**: ?page=2
    </Step>
    <Step title="pageSize (required, number)">
        Specifies the number of organizations to return per page. This helps to control the size of the response data.
        pageSize must not be greater than 100.
        **Example**: ?pageSize=10
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Search Parameters

The following parameters are supported to search users:
<Steps>
    <Step title="name">
        To search the users in the organization based on the name, you need to pass the name in the request body.
        *This search parameter allows partial text matching*.

    </Step>
    <Step title="email">

        To search the users in the organization based on the mail, you need to pass the email of the user
        in the request body. *This search parameter allows partial text matching*.
    </Step>

</Steps>

    <Info>
        The search operation is exclusive and applies AND logic between parameters.
        This means that if multiple parameters are provided
        (e.g., name, email, and role), only users that match all specified
        criteria will be returned.
    </Info>

Upon successful request, you will receive a paginated response similar to the below:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "total": 10
  },
  "users": [
    {
      "id": "1234567890",

      ],
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "displayName": "John Doe"
    }

```
