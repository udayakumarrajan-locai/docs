<Warning>
    <b>For human users</b>:

    - Send a valid `Authorization` header with of type `Bearer TOKEN_VALUE` where **TOKEN_VALUE** is the token returned in the response from [Sign up](/api-tutorials/unauthenticated-flows/sign-up-by-username-password#sign-up-a-user) or [Sign in](/api-tutorials/unauthenticated-flows/sign-in-by-username-password) flow

    In case your app supports cookie, you can enable request cookies as our API Automatically sets a cookie named `session-token` which is forwarded with each request to our api.
</Warning>

To update organization details, you need to make a PATCH request to the following endpoint along with the organization ID:

<Info>

    This endpoint is accessible to
    - Machine Users
    - Organization Owner
    - Organization User Manager

</Info>
```bash
curl --request PATCH \
  --url https://dev-iam.razi.ai/v1/authorization/organizations/__ORGID__ \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'X-App-Name: ' \
  --data '{
  "metadata": {
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": "value2"
  }
}'
```

Upon successful request, you will receive a paginated response similar to the below:

```json
{
  "message": "Organization Data Updated"
}
```

<Check>
    The API currently supports updating/adding the organization metadata.
