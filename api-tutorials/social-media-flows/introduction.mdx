<Step title="Enable Social Media Integration">

In order to enable social media integration for your application
we need to follow 2 steps:
1. [Register](/api-tutorials/social-media-flows/oauth-providers/google-idp) your application with IAM server, for this we need client_id and client_secret of your oauth application.
2. Whitelist callback urls of auth server in your oauth provider console.

<Note>
Step 1 is only allowed for SUPER Admin user

<Step title="Social Media Integration in client application">


Here is a sequence diagram for the social media integration from clients

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Client as Client App
  participant IAM-API as IAM API
  participant OAuth as OAuth Provider<br/>(Google, Microsoft...)

  Client ->> +IAM-API: (GET) /v1/authentication/apps/metadata
  IAM-API ->> -Client: Return idConfigs
  

  Note over Client: Use idpConfigs to render social media buttons

  Client ->> +IAM-API: (POST) /v1/authentication/idp/intents/create
  IAM-API ->> -Client: Return authUrl

  Note over Client: Use authUrl to redirect <br/> to google/microsoft OAuth Process

  Client ->> +OAuth: Redirect to authUrl returned above
  alt is authenticated successfully
    OAuth ->> Client: Redirect to success page
  else is authentication failed
     OAuth ->> Client: Redirect to failure page
  end
  deactivate OAuth

  Client ->> +IAM-API: (POST) /v1/authentication/idp/intents/validate
  
  alt if user email exists
    IAM-API ->> IAM-API: Link social media account and update access token
  else
    IAM-API ->> IAM-API: Create user with social media account info and token
  end
  IAM-API ->> -Client: Return Session Info
```

Next steps in documentation will explain how to implement the above flow in your client application.
