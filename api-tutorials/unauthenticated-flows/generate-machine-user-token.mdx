To generate an access token for a machine or service user, you will first need to obtain the machine user’s client ID and secret.
These credentials can be used to authenticate and gain access to the API programmatically.


<Steps>

<Step title="Obtain Machine User Credentials">
    1. First, create a machine user by making a POST request to the appropriate endpoint
    (as described in **[this](../authenticated-flows/create-machine-user)** section).
    2. The response will include the machine user’s clientId and clientSecret.
</Step>

<Step title="Generate Access Token">
    1. Use the clientId and clientSecret obtained from the machine user creation
       API to generate an access token.
    2. The access token is required to authenticate subsequent API requests.

```bash
    curl --request POST \
    --url https://dev-iam.razi.ai/v1/authentication/machine-users/access-token \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'X-App-Name: ' \
    --data '{
    "clientId": "example-client-id",
    "clientSecret": "zNUTk6frtcdrpEbRiOYx3lGjZpou1oRGVxt40SUj2qkBzUVh8gybTmOObmFvDPKw"
}'
```
Upon successful generation of the access token, you will receive a response similar to the below:

```json
{
    "token": "<JWT TOKEN>",
    "expiresInSeconds": 43199
}
```
    <Note>
        Please note that if the token is expired after the time specified in the expiresInSeconds field,
        a new token needs to be generated to access the API resources.
    </Note>

</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
    This token can now be used to authenticate API requests on behalf of the machine user
