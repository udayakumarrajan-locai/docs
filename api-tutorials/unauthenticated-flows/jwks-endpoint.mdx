<Note>
  This API Should be used to introspect the JWT for the machine user to ensure the token is issued by the IAM service.
</Note>


The **Get User JWKs** endpoint allows you to retrieve JSON Web Keys (JWKs) used to verify the signatures of tokens issued by the authentication service.
JWKs are a JSON-based data structure representing cryptographic keys and are commonly used in secure applications to ensure token integrity.


To retrieve the JWKs, make a GET request to the following endpoint:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://dev-iam.razi.ai/v1/authentication/token/jwks \
  --header 'X-App-Name: '
```

Upon successful request, you will receive keys:

```json
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "alg": "ES256",
      "crv": "P-256",
      "d": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789-_",
      "kid": "key1",
      "kty": "EC",
      "use": "sig",
      "x": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789-_",
      "y": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789-_"
    }
  ]
}
```
## Response Fields

<Check>

    **keys**: An array of key objects, where each object contains the following fields:
    - **alg**: The algorithm used with the key. In this example, `ES256` stands for the ECDSA algorithm using the P-256 curve and SHA-256 hash function.
    - **crv**: The curve parameter for elliptic curve keys. Here, `P-256` specifies the NIST P-256 curve.
    - **d**: The private key for elliptic curve cryptography, which should be kept secret and is used for signing operations.
    - **kid**: The key ID, which is a unique identifier for the key.
    - **kty**: The key type, which indicates the cryptographic algorithm family used by the key. For instance, `EC` stands for elliptic curve.
    - **use**: The intended use of the key, such as `sig` for signature verification.
    - **x** and **y**: The public key coordinates for elliptic curve keys, representing the X and Y coordinates on the curve.

    A sample implementation of the JWKS endpoint can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken#jwtverifytoken-secretorpublickey-options-callback).

    This method is also available in the [IAM SDK 1.0.9](https://github.com/LocAI1/iam-javascript-sdk/blob/main/packages/iam-javascript/src/helpers/jwt.ts).
