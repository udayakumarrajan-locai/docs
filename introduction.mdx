  <Card title="CQRS" icon="square-5" href="/">
    Our API follows the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern, which separates the handling of queries and commands into distinct models, allowing for better scalability and high availability. Queries (read operations) and commands (write operations) are processed independently, enabling efficient resource utilization and optimized performance.

  <Card title="Event Sourcing" icon="timeline" href="/">
    Our authentication service leverages Event Sourcing, a powerful pattern that captures all state changes as immutable events. This approach allows us to observe and reconstruct the entire authentication history, enabling us to trace and analyze user activities, detect anomalies, and recover from any state, ensuring data integrity and auditability. With Event Sourcing, we can replay events to reconstruct the authentication data at any given point in time, providing a robust foundation for security and compliance.
