React SDK provides a set of components and hooks for interacting with the IAM backend.

Using this library, you can quickly start using the IAM service backend.

The library can be used at three levels of abstraction:

1. Fully ready-made components: provide out-of-the-box functionality for authorization,
registration, password recovery, and user data management. These components may be expanded/modified
as the library evolves. The downside of this approach is that these components cannot be customized.
The design of the components is built in light tones using the shadcn UI library.

2. Composite elements level: represents a set of components for building custom forms.
All components available at the first level are built from composite elements. With these components,
you can easily create a full-fledged component (authorization, registration, etc.) with your own
structure, pass style classes, your own event handlers, texts for labels and buttons.

3. Hook Level: represents a set of hooks for working with the backend.
With these hooks, you can create your own components.
The hooks provide functionality for authentication, registration, password recovery,
and user data management. Hooks can be used in any component, including components created at
the second level.
