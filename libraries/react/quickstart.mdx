## Set your environment variables

To configure your application, you'll need to set the following environment variables in your `.env.local` file.
These variables are essential for connecting to the IAM service and defining your application settings.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash .env.local
  NEXT_PUBLIC_IAM_BASE_URL=https://dev-iam.razi.ai
  NEXT_PUBLIC_IAM_APP_NAME=locai
  ````
</CodeGroup>

## Add IAM provider to your React app

Integrate the IAM provider into your React application by wrapping your components with the `IamProvider`.
This allows you to leverage IAM functionalities.

Import the styles and provide configuration from environment variables.

```typescript layout.tsx
import { IamProvider } from "@locai1/iam-react";

import "@locai1/iam-react/styles.css";

const IAM_BASE_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_IAM_BASE_URL;
const IAM_APP_NAME = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_IAM_APP_NAME;

  export default function RootLayout({
    children,
  }: Readonly<{
    children: ReactNode;
  }>) {
    return (
      <IamProvider
        iamBaseUrl={IAM_BASE_URL}
        iamAppName={IAM_APP_NAME}
      >
        {children}
      </IamProvider>
    );
}
```
